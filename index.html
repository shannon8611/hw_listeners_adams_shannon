        <h1>Black Cat</h1>
        <p>A ghost, though invisible, still is like a place
            your sight can knock on, echoing; but here
            within this thick black pelt, your strongest gaze
            will be absorbed and utterly disappear:</p>

        <p>just as a raving madman, when nothing else
            can ease him, charges into his dark night
            howling, pounds on the padded wall, and feels
            the rage being taken in and pacified.</p>

        <p>She seems to hide all looks that have ever fallen
            into her, so that, like an audience,
            she can look them over, menacing and sullen,
            and curl to sleep with them. But all at once</p>

        <p>as if awakened, she turns her face to yours;
            and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny,
            inside the golden amber of her eyeballs
            suspended, like a prehistoric fly. </p>
